The Autobin Project is designed for my school project (July 2, 2015)

The Auto Bin is for public park or any other places that needs a bin that can automatically search a place with two geared motors and some tricky sensors for automatic drive (Ultra Sonic & IR sensors mounted on all directions of its base plate)

> Avoiding detected obstacle using sensors

Main Function that drive the bin is the Random function. (This is just trick that imitates robot vaccum).

All the code is hard-coded based as this is just school project for code beginner or electrical engineeing major students in school.

What Needed:

- Geared Motor: RB-35GM
- Motor Drive: L298
- 3cells Li-Po battery
- Controller: Arduino Uno
- Water Pump (Rated Voltage: 9 to 15V)
- 7805 Regulator
- Diode for reverse current protection.
- Sonar Sensor
- IR Sensors
- LM-35
- HC-05.
